# Assignment: Java Traits
## Description  
In this assignment, you will implement a Java program that uses traits to represent various animal types and behaviors. The program will allow users to create and interact with animals of different types, and will demonstrate the use of traits to define and compose behavior.

## Requirements
1. Implement a Trait interface that defines a method for each behavior that an animal can exhibit. The interface should include at least four behaviors, such as eat, move, makeSound, and rest.  
2. Implement a set of concrete classes that represent different types of animals, such as Lion, Gazelle, and Elephant. Each animal class should implement the Trait interface and provide its own implementation of each behavior method.  
3. Implement a Zoo class that allows users to create and interact with animals of different types. The Zoo class should include methods for adding and removing animals, and for performing each of the behaviors defined in the Trait interface.
4. Demonstrate the use of traits to define and compose behavior. For example, an animal of type Lion might implement the eat behavior by using its claws trait to catch and kill prey, while an animal of type Gazelle might implement the rest behavior by hiding in tall grass to avoid predators.  
## Deliverables
1. A functional Java program that implements the Trait, Lion, Gazelle, Elephant, and Zoo classes, and that allows users to create and interact with animals of different types.
2. A documentation file that describes the program's design, implementation, and testing. The documentation should include a description of the Trait interface, examples of the program's input and output, and an evaluation of the program's effectiveness and limitations.
## Optional Enhancements
1. Implement additional animal types and behaviors, such as Bird, Fish, and Swim.
2. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Zoo class, to make it more accessible and user-friendly.
3. Implement unit tests for the Trait, Lion, Gazelle, Elephant, and Zoo classes, to ensure that they are functioning correctly.

## Evaluation
The program will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

 **Functionality:** Does the program allow users to create and interact with animals of different types, and demonstrate the use of traits to define and compose behavior?  
**Design:** Is the program well-designed, with clear and understandable class and method names, and appropriate use of traits to define behavior?
Documentation: Is the documentation clear, detailed, and informative, and does it provide a thorough description of the program's design, implementation, and testing?  
**Enhancements:** Are any optional enhancements implemented effectively and correctly, and do they add value to the program?
